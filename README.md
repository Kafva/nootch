# nootch
Some Macbook models (e.g. Macbook Pro M3) have a black 'notch' at the top of
the screen, this is annoying. This simple program changes to a lower supported
resolution, hiding the notch (but also reducing the screen space).

```bash
swift build -c release
./.build/arm64-apple-macosx/release/nootch
```
